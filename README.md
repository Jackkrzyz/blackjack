# How to play

1. **Objective**  
   Try to get a hand value as close to 21 as possible, without going over. Beat the dealer’s hand without exceeding 21.

2. **Card Values**  
   - Number cards (2–10): Face value  
   - Face cards (J, Q, K): 10 points each  
   - Ace (A): 1 or 11 points (whichever is more favorable for your hand)

3. **Game Start**  
   - Each player and the dealer are dealt two cards.  
   - Players’ cards are usually face up; the dealer has one card face up and one face down.

4. **Player’s Turn**  
   - **Hit:** Take another card.  
   - **Stand:** Keep your current hand.  
   - **Double Down:** Double your bet, take one more card, then stand.  
   - **Split:** If you have two cards of the same value, split them into two hands (optional, if allowed).

5. **Dealer’s Turn**  
   - Dealer reveals their hidden card.  
   - Dealer must hit until their cards total 17 or higher.

6. **Winning**  
   - If your hand is closer to 21 than the dealer’s, you win.  
   - If you go over 21, you bust and lose.  
   - If the dealer busts and you don’t, you win.  
   - If both have the same value, it’s a push (tie).

7. **Blackjack**  
   - If your first two cards are an Ace and a 10-value card, you have “Blackjack” and win 1.5x your bet (unless the dealer also has Blackjack).

Enjoy playing!
